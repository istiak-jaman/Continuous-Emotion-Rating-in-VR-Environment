Note: Videos will not download with the system from Git, they're too big. 
Instead, I'll try to keep a repository of videos at this link: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aq4hQfoPthXzhLZbFx2D24oQJCbnIQ?e=axQMCn

Go there and download those videos to the Resources/Videos folder. Make sure the name matches what's in the sequence file.
